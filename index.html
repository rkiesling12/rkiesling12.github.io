								<p>In the Data Science Program, I was able to improve my programming skills in Python and to spend more time working with SQL. Through a variety of drills, assignments, and projects, I learned a variety of data visualization, experimental design, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning techniques.

								<p>Data Scientist with experience using Python, SQL, and Excel. Also experienced in research and experimental design, data visualization, and project management.

I love solving problems and figuring out new insights about the world. I am fascinated by digging into data about a wide range of subjects, and I am known for keeping detailed spreadsheets about aspects of my life from vacation planning to all of the books that Iâ€™ve read over the past few years. In college, I majored in math because I loved numbers and problem solving and chemistry because I thought I wanted to be a scientist. Come to find out, I actually hated working in a lab, but I did love numbers and problem-solving.

After college, I worked for a textbook company for a year as a Mathematics Project Assistant, which basically meant that I helped all of the math-related teams (textbooks, e-books, online resources etc.) with a variety of project-related tasks. While this role taught me a lot of valuable time management and organizational skills, I found myself looking for a position that was more technical; however, I did not have the technical skills required by many of the job postings I was looking at. I decided to join Thinkful to learn the skills necessary to succeed as a data scientist. I have loved learning a wide range of data visualization, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning techniques.

Connect with me if you're interested in someone who is curious and eager to learn, hopes to make a meaningful impact using data, and has the best book recommendations.
